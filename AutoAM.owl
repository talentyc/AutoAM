Whereas the BFO term 'disposition refers to all tendencies, powers, habits, skills, potentials, and so forth, that a material entity may possess, a Capability narrows this down by requiring the existence of an Agent that has an interest in the realization of the capability

2. This definition does not attempt to capture \"task-based\" capabilities that an entity may bear -- e.g., a stone's capability to kill when used by some person. Rather, it captures \"proper capabilities.\" See related discussion of \"proper functions\" in the literature. 

3. All functions are capabilities and in a future release BFO:Function will be asserted directly under capability.  

4. Not all capabilities are functions. Capabilities are often added to an artifact by the designer/engineer, or to a biological entity through evolution, as \"additional benefits,\" and are differentiated from function (i.e., purpose). Examples: the air conditioner in your car is a capability but not the function of your car. Yet the function of the car air conditioner certainly forms some material basis of your car's ability to provide a comfortable experience. The ability of your heart to beat fast to support your need to run fast to escape a threat. The decaying stick on the forest lawn does not have the function to be used as a tool, but certainly a chimpanzee
 may have an interest in using a stick to extract food from a termite mound.""" ,
                                 "Maybe describing Capability vs. Function per Chandrasekaran and Josephson (2000) is a better way to go? Capability = Environment Centric Function and Function = Device Centric function. Function of a Drill is to remove material, it has capability to create hole in a workpiece. Function of a bulb is to produce light/photon particles, it has illumination capability. Capabilities are enabled by functions." ;
